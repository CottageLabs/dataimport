  "description": "The COVID-19 Sex-Disaggregated Data Tracker assesses the availability of sex-disaggregated data from over 200 countries (and counting). Data was previously updated every two weeks, but from April 2021 was collected and reported monthly. Due to a decline in country reporting of COVID-19 data, we have paused manual data collection. The final round of manual data collection was conducted in June 2022. The dashboard will continue to be updated monthly with sex-disaggregated data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from the WHO COVID-19 Detailed Surveillance Data Dashboard. At present no other variables will be updated with new data.",

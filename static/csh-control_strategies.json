  "description": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions were decided under rapidly changing, conjectural conditions, with limited (if any) prior experience. Worldwide, governments have implemented country-specific control strategies to prevent the introduction and mitigate the spread of the virus. However, were those measures effective?\n\nResearchers at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna are building a comprehensive database of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken by the governments worldwide in order to assess the impact of these actions on the spread of the COVID-19 in the respective countries.",
